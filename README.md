# Installation Instructions
Have lots of PIs, wire up as shown in the video.
Run client.py on each PI. Run server.py on one server, which then figures out the connections between nodes.


For using connect to the web api and enter where the train is, where you currently are and your destination.

# Technical Description
Protocol for neighbour discovery between "train stations" (raspberry pis).
Optimal routing algorithms based on amount of passengers at each station. 
As a connection is disconnected, automatically reroute passengers, so they can get to their destination.

All work has been completed within the timeframe.
